## Features

* **Virtual Closet:** Meticulously track your entire wardrobe, including what you wear and how often.

* **Style Sharing & Influence:** Share your outfits with a community and be influenced by or influence others' fashion choices.

* **Open Closet Suggestions:** Post a status for an upcoming event (e.g., "Casual get-together with friends") and let the community build outfit suggestions from items in your virtual closet.

* **Barcode Scanning:** Scan clothing item barcodes to automatically retrieve material information.

* **Sustainability Analytics:** Get insights into the lifespan and environmental impact of your clothing, advocating for more sustainable material choices.

## How It's Made:

Drip is built as a robust, full-stack application leveraging modern technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** Developed with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities, **React** for building a dynamic user interface, and **TypeScript** for enhanced code quality and maintainability. Styling is handled efficiently with **Tailwind CSS**, providing a utility-first approach for responsive and customizable designs.

* **Backend:** Powered by **Java** with **Spring Boot**, creating a highly performant and scalable RESTful API. The backend follows the **Model-Repository-Controller** architectural pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns, robust data management, and easy extensibility.

* **Database:** A robust database solution is utilized to store complex user data, virtual closet items, social interactions, and clothing analytics.

* **Integration:** Designed to integrate with external services for advanced features like barcode data retrieval and potential future AI/ML-driven style recommendations.

## Optimizations

* **Efficient Data Handling:** Focus on optimized data structures and queries to manage extensive virtual closets and detailed clothing analytics without compromising performance.

* **Fast Asset Delivery:** Strategies for efficient image loading and asset delivery are implemented to ensure a smooth and responsive social media feed experience.

* **Robust API Design:** The backend API is designed for high throughput and low latency, facilitating rapid communication between the frontend and server.

* **Scalability:** The modular architecture across both frontend and backend layers is designed for future scaling, accommodating a growing user base and increasing data complexity.

## Lessons Learned:

Through the development of Drip, I gained significant experience in:

* Building a comprehensive full-stack application with a distinct Java Spring Boot backend and a Next.js/TypeScript frontend.

* Handling complex data modeling challenges related to clothing items, wear tracking, user preferences, and social interactions.

* Developing an interactive and engaging social media platform, including real-time (or near real-time) features for style sharing and outfit suggestions.

* Exploring the integration of external services, such as barcode scanners and potential AI models for material analysis, into a cohesive user experience.

* Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for a secure social media environment.

* Emphasizing modular development and clear separation of concerns to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

## Installation

To set up and run Drip locally, follow these steps:

### Backend (Java/Spring Boot)

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+ and Gradle installed on your system.

2.  **Navigate:** Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project (`drip/`).

3.  **Build:** Build the backend application.

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build # For Linux/macOS
    # or
    gradlew.bat build # For Windows
    ```

### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)

1.  **Navigate:** Change your directory to the frontend application:

    ```bash
    cd drip-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all necessary Node.js packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

### Backend

1.  **Start the Backend Server:** From the `drip` root directory, run:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun # For Linux/macOS
    # or
    gradlew.bat bootRun # For Windows
    ```

    The backend API will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend

1.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:** From the `drip-frontend` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The frontend application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
